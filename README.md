## Warning!
Consider this code/program as in the beta stage. This means that any GCODE generated should be handled carefully. I recommend trying first the generated GCODE without the milling tool and with enough distance from the milling head to the table, also to set up the feed/seek rates I recommend using a wood base material to test which speed is better for your case.
